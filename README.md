# lifetrack
Linux memory monitor and alarm and time tracker graphical tkinter


##lifetrack 
is intended to be a linux only program as it specifically uses 
many features of linux to monitor memory and process that is not easily
available in other sytems as well as reducing the complexity of dealing
with versions of software that has hidden specifications which can change
and render the software useless without a means to correct the problem.

This is also intended to be a teaching process 
and each part of how to use this program is to be documented to allow
modification for whatever purposes a person might apply it.

It originated because I wanted to see how various aspects of memory
management could better be displayed and monitored that the 
system monitor application GUI. Specifically how much cache was allocated
 and how that impacted performance as well as attempting to identify
 applications that leaked memory over a long term.
 
For business I wanted a simple utility to track time per job easily
and produce reports for billing or simply to identify time costs
of a project.


Version history
2016 - Dec 18 8AM CST
Initial version is just a mish mash of all the different widgets to see
how each was instantiated and how that looked and acted in practice 
as well as trying different types of layout for visual attractiveness
as well as antipattern disturbance
All the pieces are there, now just need to arrange them into a coherent
program with an intuitive GUI
